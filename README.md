#How to Commit:
______________________
-- Place all source files in the source/ dir

-- In general, keep functions pertaining to different effects in different files

-- Name variables descriptively. If a variable pertains to a common physics term
       or symbol, place that symbol in a nearby comment

-- Comment functions explaining the math in use 

-- Add any new effect into this README

#General Git Etiquette:
______________________
-- *DO NOT commit executables* (.out files by default)

-- DO NOT make dated folders in any directory except output/

-- In general, avoid committing output files - the output directory is a 
       compromise between programming convention and needs of professors and 
       students in class.  Remember - you can always store your outputs in the 
       Google Drive or on iGroups.

-- That said, DO NOT commit output files unless:

-- -- You have a good reason to track the output (IE, showing new functionality)

-- -- You have placed the output in a dated directory within the output/ dir
